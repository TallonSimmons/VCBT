# Project Overview
* This is architected following the clean architecure principals (or onion, ports and adapters, whatever terminology you may use).
* cd into `VacoBuiltCodeTest.Web` and `dotnet run`; app will startup on port:7215
* I decided to go for an application first approach, and delay database implementation until the very end, as such, I ran out of time to implement that.
